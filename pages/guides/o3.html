                                <p>Choose the Right Class: Opt for classes with high mobility and survivability, such as
                                    the Trickster or Knight, to navigate the arena effectively and avoid damage.</p>
                                <p>Understand the Arena Layout: Familiarize yourself with the arena's layout to
                                    anticipate enemy movements and plan your positioning accordingly.</p>
                                <p>Manage Minions Efficiently: Focus on eliminating minions promptly to prevent them
                                    from overwhelming you and your team.</p>
                                <p>Coordinate with Your Team: Communicate with your team to ensure synchronized
                                    movements and strategies, enhancing overall effectiveness.</p>
                                <p>Maintain Focus and Patience: Stay alert and patient throughout the encounter, as Oryx
                                    3 can be challenging, but persistence leads to success.</p>
                            </details>
                            <p>Oryx’s Sanctuary is an endgame dungeon designed to be the most challenging content in the
                                game, surpassing even endgame dungeons such as the Lost Halls and The Shatters. This
                                dungeon is one of the Exaltation dungeons, boosting Life, and notably has a 50% chance
                                to grant an additional Exaltation.</p>

                            <p>The Sanctuary is accessible after defeating Oryx the Mad God 2 in the Wine Cellar; all
                                three Oryx Runes must be used to unlock the portal, although the runes will be returned
                                to the respective players if not all three are present. However, there is a small chance
                                that one or more of the runes will be already active upon defeating Oryx 2, which
                                includes an extremely small chance that all three will activate and the portal will open
                                by itself upon a Wine Cellar clear.</p>
                            <p><b>The animation for unlocking Oryx’s Sanctuary:</b></p>

                            <p>The dungeon is the only source of T7 abilities, while being one of two sources of T14
                                armors and T14 weapons; it also drops a large number of incredibly powerful UT items
                                (20) divided among five themed sets, Shaman Necromancer Set Shard, Mad Minotaur Set
                                Shard, Astral Arcanist Set Shard and is the sole drop location of the Angelic Bard Set.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>This dungeon must be completed to earn ‘Travel of the Decade‘, ‘Hero of the Nexus’ and
                                    ‘Realm of the Mad God’ fame bonuses.</b></p>

                            <h2>Layout</h2>

                            <p>The dungeon has a fixed layout consisting of four wings. All players will spawn in one
                                randomly chosen wing in each instance of the dungeon, with the spawn room containing a
                                destructible chest that contains a large amount of Health Potions and Magic Potions.
                                Each wing is themed after a particular boss that will be fought before encountering Oryx
                                the Mad God 3 at the center of the dungeon. Players cannot enter other wings and fight
                                the other bosses aside from the one initially assigned. The early parts of the dungeon
                                consist primarily of dark blue floors and brick wall tiles with columns, arches, and
                                ornate green windows that distort light. Each wing contains unique decorative objects
                                throughout, and the later parts have unique wing-specific tilesets. There are also
                                banners and colored carpet specific to each wing.</p>

                            <p>Players must completely clear three sequential rooms of enemies before confronting the
                                “miniboss” of the wing. Each room has its own fixed formation of enemies, and the number
                                of enemies in the three rooms is consistent regardless of wing (6/12/16 for each room,
                                respectively, for a total of 34 enemies). After the boss is defeated, players will
                                traverse a long hallway with no enemies before the final battle with Oryx 3. The exit to
                                each room is initially blocked with a large spiked gate. The gate will disappear and
                                allow access to the next room once all enemies in the current room are defeated.</p>
                            <h3>North Wing</h3>

                            <p>Governed by Chancellor Dammah and is color-coded red.</p>
                            <p>Dammah’s area is themed after a government building. It contains intricate, dark gray to
                                black large diamond floor tiles, dark blue carpet with Dammah’s “D” insigna, and high
                                walls with Dammah’s signature red banners, antelope skull decorations, purple flame
                                torches, and large ornate windows. Large tables containing various paper documents also
                                serve as obstacles. The papers will also be scattered throughout the ground.</p>
                            <p>Unlike his cohorts, Dammah’s boss room is simply a large square chamber with no
                                decorations of note.</p>

                            <p>Gemsbok’s area is themed after a treasure vault. It contains light gray floor tiles and
                                red and blue carpet, along with the usual dark blue carpet with Gemsbok’s “G” insigna
                                and his signature yellow banners. Scattered throughout are various “pedestals” formed by
                                intricate golden tiles and containing colored gemstone tiles or decorative treasure
                                objects. The high walls consist of ornate, light gray columns with golden flair.</p>
                            <p>Gemsbok’s arena is a large square room decorated similarly to the rest of the wing, with
                                red-and-blue carpets and piles of treasure adorning the corners of the chamber. Four
                                golden platforms inset with gems are present on the cardinal sides of the arena, which
                                indicate Gemsbok’s teleportation locations during the battle.</p>

                            <p>Governed by Archbishop Leucoryx and is color-coded blue.</p>
                            <p>Leucoryx’s area is themed after a cathedral. It consists of large, dark blue, square
                                floor tiles each with an intricate pattern, along with dark blue carpet with Leucoryx’s
                                “L” insigna and his signature blue banners. Decorative torture/execution devices
                                (guillotines, iron maidens, pillories, racks, breaking wheels) and skeletons, sometimes
                                hanging from chains, are scattered throughout. The edges of Leucoryx’s room are
                                decorated with candelabra. The walls mostly consist of dark blue skull piles.</p>
                            <p>Leucoryx’s arena is a large, rectangular, church-like room whose walls are initially
                                decorated with orange, light-distorting stained windows with a sun motif. After Leucoryx
                                transforms into his Chaos form, the stained glass will become light blue and purple. The
                                central wall will now have a stained glass design consisting of a blue circle surrounded
                                by purple and yellow crescent moon shapes, representing Leucoryx’s light and dark forms.

                            <p>Governed by Chief Beisa and is color-coded green.</p>
                            <p>Beisa’s area is themed after a military training ground. The floors contain plain, often
                                cracked gray stone tiles, along with dark blue carpet with Beisa’s “B” insigna and his
                                signature green banners. Decorative training dummies, archery targets with arrows,
                                weapons on display stands, and suits of armor designed for his three minion types are
                                present.</p>
                            <p>Beisa’s arena contains gray to dark blue tiles which form a geometric pattern designed as
                                a 3x3 grid. The edges of the boss room will become an impassable void once the fight
                                with Beisa starts, leaving only the central 3x3 grid. The high walls consist of dark

                            <p>Central Chamber</p>

                            <p>Oryx the Mad God 3 awaits in this chamber.</p>
                            <p>Oryx’s room and the preceding long hallways contain dark blue carpet with his red “Ω”
                                insigna and Oryx-themed banners. The hallway walls contain intricate, stained glass
                                windows depicting Oryx the Mad God which distort light. The floor tiles are similar to
                                the ones in the early parts of the dungeon but are dark gray to black instead of dark
                                blue. Once Oryx turns into his Exalted form, the floor tiles will brighten
                                significantly, becoming gray to white. At the end of the battle, the floor of the arena
                                will be destroyed, transforming into a starry void with various planets floating within.
